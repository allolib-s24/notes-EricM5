##Piece 1: Pentatonic Roulette

This piece is completely randomly generated and nondeterministic. Pentatonic Roulette leverages pentatonic scales to ensure great sounding melodies. Every time the program is run, a random beats per minute (bpm) is generated from [60,180]. The number of measures for the piece, which determines it's length,  is also a randomly chosen integer from [8,25]. A random pentatonic scale is then chosen. While the piece is playing, another random integer is generated to determine whether a specific note plays at a given beat (which was determined by the bpm). Each note within the selected penatonic scale has an equal probability of being chosen for a given beat.

I included a Hi-Hat that I synthesized from my music synthesis project that plays for every beat and provides structure to the piece.

I decided to focus on percussion as I began picking up the drums this academic year. I focused primarily on the bass drum and the Hi-Hat

For my final project, I decided to create an application that would help prospective CS190D students learn music theory. My main focus was limiting the barriers to entry to CS190D for students who don't have a strong music background.
